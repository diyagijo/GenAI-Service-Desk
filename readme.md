# ü§ñ Gen AI-Powered IT Service Desk Agent (RAG)

This is a professional-grade, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system built to solve a core business problem for IT service providers.

It automates a Level 1 IT Help Desk by answering employee questions using a trusted, private knowledge base. This reduces ticket volume, prevents AI "hallucinations," and ensures data privacy.





### üí° The Business Problem (The "Why")

A massive part of UST's business is **IT Services & BPO (Business Process Outsourcing)**. They run the help desks for Fortune 500 companies. This process is expensive, time-consuming, and hard to scale.

A simple "toy" chatbot is not the solution, as it can:
1.  **Hallucinate:** Make up answers and confuse employees.
2.  **Leak Data:** Be trained on (or leak) private company information.

This project solves both of these critical business problems.

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works: The RAG Pipeline

This is an "industrial-strength" AI application, not just a model. It is an end-to-end system built for trust and control.



1.  **Ingest & Store:** On startup, the app loads all `.txt` files from a `knowledge_base/` folder. It uses `SentenceTransformer` to convert them into vector embeddings and stores them in a local, high-speed `FAISS` vector database.
2.  **Retrieve (The "R"):** When a user asks a question, the app searches the vector database for the **Top-1** (`k=1`) most semantically similar document. This ensures only the *most relevant* fact is used.
3.  **Augment & Generate (The "G"):** The app passes this single, relevant document (the "context") to the Gemini API with a strict **System Prompt** that commands it to:
    * Answer *only* using the provided context.
    * Refuse to answer if the information is not present.
4.  **Cite (The "Trust" Feature):** The app displays its answer *and* the source file it used, proving it is not hallucinating and making its answer auditable.
